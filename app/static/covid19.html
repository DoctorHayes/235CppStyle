<h1 class="title">CSU COVID-19 Guidelines</h1>
<p>The following four scenarios should help guide faculty and students regarding COVID-19 cases and exposures in their classrooms for the Fall 2022 semester.</p>

<div id="course-description" class="section level1">
<h1>Scenario 1</h1>
<p>You have tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Stay home and self-isolate.</strong></li>
	<li>Do not go to work or class for at least 5 days after your symptoms start or 5 days after your test date (if
you have no symptoms).
		<ul>
			<li>Note that the date of symptom onset and/or positive test is designated as day 0.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Students should inform their instructors that they will not be in class for at least 5 days.</strong></li>
	<li>End isolation after 5 days, returning to normal activity on day 6 if you are fever free for 24 hours</li>
without the use of fever-reducing medication and your other symptoms have improved.
	<li>If you are still febrile on day 5, remain in isolation until you are fever-free for 24 hours without the use</li>
of fever-reducing medication and your other symptoms have improved.
	<li>If you experience moderate illness, indicated by shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, you should isolate through day 10.</li>
	<li>If you experience severe illness, indicated by hospitalization, or have a weakened immune system, you</li>
should isolate through at least day 10 and consult your healthcare provider prior to ending isolation.
	<li>If your symptoms worsen after ending isolation, restart your isolation period at day 0 and consult a healthcare provider.
	<li>Wear a well-fitting surgical mask or N95 for 10 full days any time you are around others inside your home or in public.
		<li>Avoid travel; do not</li> go to places where you are unable to mask.
		<li>Regardless of when you end isolation, avoid people who are more likely to get very sick from
COVID-19 through day 11.
</ul>
