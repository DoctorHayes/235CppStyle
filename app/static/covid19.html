<h1 class="title">CSU COVID-19 Guidelines</h1>
<p>The following four scenarios should help guide faculty and students regarding COVID-19 cases and exposures in their classrooms for the Fall 2022 semester.</p>

<div id="course-description" class="section level1">

	<li>End isolation after day 5 if you are fever free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and your other symptoms have improved.</li>
	<li>If you are still febrile on day 5, remain in isolation until you are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and your other symptoms have improved.</li>
	<li>Wear a well-fitting surgical mask or N95 for 10 full days any time you are around others inside your home or in public.
